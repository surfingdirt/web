"Well, I pretty much like everything about the Matrix II, the turning is so much more progressive and responsive than any other truck I‚Äôve ridden before plus it‚Äôs lighter and the shape of the lower truck is so much better for rails, copings and ground clearance. The one thing I didn‚Äôt like was its preload system, after a certain point the more I tried to stiffen the steering, the looser it got.\n"

MBS kept tweaking the design over the years, making improvements, always producing something that kept them ahead of their rivals. However because of my background in motor cycle mechanics I always thought it was odd to use a spring without any form of rebound dampening and that‚Äôs why in 2010 I decided on a bit of an experiment, to run my Matrix Pro‚Äôs without any springs. To my surprise it worked incredibly well for me and quite a few other riders."
